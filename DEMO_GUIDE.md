## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

Edit `configs/trading_config.yaml` to customize the training environment:

### Market Parameters
```yaml
market:
  initial_price: 100.0      # Starting price
  volatility: 0.02          # Market volatility  
  liquidity_factor: 0.1     # Market liquidity
  spread_min: 0.01          # Minimum bid-ask spread
  spread_max: 0.05          # Maximum bid-ask spread
  order_book_depth: 10      # Order book levels
  tick_size: 0.01           # Price increment
```

### Agent Configuration (Single Agent Demo)
```yaml
agents:
  market_maker:
    count: 1                # Always 1 for single-agent demo
    initial_capital: 100000 # Starting capital
    risk_tolerance: 0.1     # Risk appetite
    inventory_target: 0     # Target inventory level
    max_inventory: 1000     # Maximum position size
    min_spread: 0.02        # Minimum spread for orders
```

### Training Parameters
```yaml
training:
  episodes: 1000            # Total training episodes
  max_steps_per_episode: 1000  # Steps per episode
  learning_rate: 0.0003     # PPO learning rate
  batch_size: 256           # Training batch size
  gamma: 0.99               # Discount factor
```

### Distributed Training
```yaml
distributed:
  num_workers: 4            # Number of parallel workers
  num_cpus_per_worker: 1    # CPUs per worker
  num_gpus: 0               # GPUs (set to 1+ if available)
```

## üìà Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Episode Reward**: Performance of the single market maker agent
2. **Episode Length**: How long episodes last (target: 500 steps)
3. **Policy Loss**: Training stability and convergence
4. **P&L (Profit & Loss)**: Actual trading performance in evaluation
5. **Action Distribution**: Balance of BUY, SELL, HOLD, CANCEL actions

### What Good Performance Looks Like

- **Episode Rewards**: Should improve over training iterations
- **Episode Lengths**: Should reach the full 500 steps consistently
- **P&L**: Positive profit in evaluation runs (though this is challenging)
- **Action Diversity**: Mix of all action types, not just HOLD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Single-Stock Environment

This demo uses a **single-stock trading environment** for simplicity. The agent trades one asset without diversification. In real trading, you'd typically want multiple stocks for portfolio management and risk reduction.

## üéØ What the Agent Can Learn

### ‚úÖ Learnable Trading Patterns

- **Mean Reversion Strategy**: Price tends to revert toward $100, agent can learn to buy low/sell high
- **Event-Based Trading**: React to market events (volatility spikes, flash crashes, news events)  
- **Risk Management**: Learn optimal position sizes and cash management
- **Market Making**: Provide liquidity and earn bid-ask spreads
- **Timing**: Learn when to be active vs. passive based on market conditions

### ‚ùå Limitations (Not Learnable)

- **No Fundamental Analysis**: No company earnings, news, or business fundamentals
- **No Cross-Asset Relationships**: Only one stock, no portfolio diversification
- **No Market Microstructure**: Simplified order book without real market depth
- **No External Factors**: No economic indicators, interest rates, or macro events
- **No Competition**: Only one agent, no other market participants to learn from

### üéØ Expected Learning Outcomes

The agent should learn to be a **single-stock day trader** with market making capabilities, focusing on mean reversion and event-based trading strategies.

## üìä Market Simulation Mechanics

### How the Market Moves

The market simulator generates realistic price movements through:

1. **Random Walk**: Basic price randomness with current volatility
2. **Mean Reversion**: Price tends to return toward initial price ($100)
3. **Trend/Momentum**: Short-term momentum based on recent price history
4. **Market Events**: 6 event types that create temporary price movements:
   - **Volatility Spike**: Increased volatility, no direction bias
   - **Liquidity Crisis**: Reduced liquidity, larger price swings
   - **News Event**: Directional bias (up or down)
   - **Flash Crash**: Sudden downward movement
   - **Flash Rally**: Sudden upward movement
   - **Normal**: No special events

### What the Agent Observes (11 features)

**Market Features (7):**
- Current price (normalized)
- Volatility level
- Liquidity level
- Trading volume
- Bid-ask spread
- Order book depth
- Event indicator (0/1 for normal/special event)

**Agent Features (4):**
- Cash balance
- Current position
- P&L
- Number of active orders
- **Training Stability**: Smooth learning curves without wild fluctuations

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Customizing Training Parameters
```yaml
# Edit configs/trading_config.yaml
training:
  episodes: 2000              # Train for more episodes
  max_steps_per_episode: 1000 # Longer episodes
  learning_rate: 0.0001       # Slower learning rate
  batch_size: 512             # Larger batch size

distributed:
  num_workers: 8              # More parallel workers
  num_gpus: 1                 # Use GPU if available
```

### Custom Market Events
```python
# Add new market events in environments/market_simulator.py
class MarketEvent(Enum):
    CUSTOM_EVENT = "custom_event"

# Implement event logic in MarketSimulator class
```

### Environment Customization

# - Adjust reward function
# - Change observation space
# - Add new market dynamics
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Anyscale Cloud Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Anyscale account
- AWS/GCP/Azure credentials
- Ray cluster configuration

### Deployment Steps
1. **Configure Distributed Training**:
   ```bash
   # Edit configs/trading_config.yaml to adjust distributed settings
   # num_workers: 4  # Number of parallel workers
   # num_cpus_per_worker: 1  # CPUs per worker
   # num_gpus: 0  # GPUs (set to 1+ if you have GPU access)
   ```

2. **Deploy Training**:
   ```bash
   uv run rllib-trading-arena train --algorithm ppo --iterations 100
   ```

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run dashboard/trading_dashboard.py
   ```

### Cloud Benefits
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjust resources based on workload
- **Cost Optimization**: Use spot instances and auto-termination
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery from node failures
- **Global Deployment**: Train across multiple regions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ray Initialization Error**:
   ```bash
   # Solution: Check Ray installation
   uv run python -c "import ray; print(ray.__version__)"
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Solution: Reduce batch size or workers
   # Edit configs/trading_config.yaml
   training:
     batch_size: 128  # Reduce from 256
   distributed:
     num_workers: 2   # Reduce from 4
   ```

3. **Dashboard Not Loading**:
   ```bash
   # Solution: Check Streamlit installation
   uv run streamlit --version
   ```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Faster Training**:
   - Increase `num_workers` in distributed config
   - Use GPU if available
   - Reduce `max_steps_per_episode`

2. **Better Results**:
   - Increase training iterations (episodes: 2000+)
   - Tune hyperparameters (learning_rate, batch_size)
   - Adjust reward function in trading_environment.py

## üìà Understanding Evaluation Results

### What to Look For in Single Agent Evaluation

**Good Performance Indicators**:
- **Diverse Actions**: Agent should use all action types (BUY, SELL, HOLD, CANCEL)
- **Risk Management**: High CANCEL percentage shows good risk management
- **Trading Activity**: Some BUY/SELL actions indicate active market making
- **Profitability**: Positive P&L in some episodes shows learning
- **Consistency**: Reasonable standard deviation in rewards

**Example Good Results**:
```
Action Distribution:
  HOLD  : 655 ( 65.5%)  # Reasonable - not all actions need trades
  CANCEL: 172 ( 17.2%)  # Good risk management
  BUY   : 121 ( 12.1%)  # Active market making
  SELL  :  52 (  5.2%)  # Profit taking

Trading Performance:
  Profitable Episodes: 2/5 (40.0%)  # Some success
  Average Profit/Episode: $ 6600.36  # Positive average
```

**Red Flags**:
- 100% HOLD actions (agent not learning)
- 0% CANCEL actions (poor risk management)
- Consistently negative P&L (poor strategy)
- Very high standard deviation (unstable learning)

## üéâ Next Steps
