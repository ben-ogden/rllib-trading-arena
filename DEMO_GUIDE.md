- **Agent Types**: Market makers, momentum traders, arbitrageurs (single-agent training)
- **Performance Metrics**: P&L, trading activity, market efficiency

## üöÄ Quick Start (10-15 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install project dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Train Single Agent
```bash
# Full training (recommended)
uv run rllib-trading-arena train --iterations 100

# Quick demo (faster)
uv run rllib-trading-arena demo --iterations 10
```

### 3. Evaluate Trained Agent
```bash
# Evaluate the trained model (separate from training)
uv run rllib-trading-arena evaluate --episodes 5
```

### 4. Launch Dashboard
```bash
# View training metrics and evaluation results
uv run trading-dashboard
```

## üéØ Train vs Demo Commands

**`train`** - Full training suite (recommended):
- Complete training with all configuration options
- Saves detailed results and metrics
- **Training only** - evaluation is separate

**`demo`** - Quick demonstration:
- Faster execution for testing
- Minimal configuration
- **Training only** - evaluation is separate
- Good for quick demos and development

**Note**: Both commands only train the agent. Use the separate `evaluate` command to test performance.

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

The demo uses `configs/trading_config.yaml` for all settings. Here are the key parameters:

### Market Parameters
```yaml
market:
  initial_price: 100.0
  volatility: 0.02
  mean_reversion: 0.1
  max_steps_per_episode: 128
```

### Agent Configuration (Single Agent Demo)
```yaml
agents:
  market_maker:
    initial_cash: 10000.0
    max_position: 100
    risk_tolerance: 0.1
```

### Training Parameters
```yaml
training:
  lr: 0.0003
  train_batch_size: 256
  gamma: 0.99
  entropy_coeff: 0.01
  minibatch_size: 64
  rollout_fragment_length: 128
```

### Distributed Training
```yaml
distributed:
  num_workers: 4
  num_cpus_per_worker: 1
  num_gpus: 0
```

## üöÄ Complete Demo: Single Agent Training & Evaluation

### Step 1: Train the Agent
```bash
# Start training (this will take 5-10 minutes)
uv run rllib-trading-arena train --iterations 100

# Watch the training progress in your terminal
# The agent will learn to make trading decisions
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Performance
```bash
# Test the trained agent
uv run rllib-trading-arena evaluate --episodes 5

# This will show you how well the agent performs
# Look for positive P&L and reasonable trading activity
```

### Step 3: View Results in Dashboard
```bash
# Launch the interactive dashboard
uv run trading-dashboard

# Open your browser to http://localhost:8501
# View training metrics and progress charts (from saved data)
```

## üìà Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Episode Reward**: Should increase over time (learning)
- **Episode Length**: Should stabilize around 128 steps
- **Policy Loss**: Should decrease (better decision making)
- **P&L**: Should be positive in evaluation (profitable trading)

### What Good Performance Looks Like
- **Training**: Episode rewards trending upward
- **Evaluation**: Positive P&L, reasonable trade frequency
- **Stability**: Consistent performance across episodes
- **Learning**: Clear improvement from random to strategic behavior

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Single-Stock Environment
This demo uses a **single stock** for simplicity. In real markets, agents would trade multiple assets, but this limitation helps focus on core RL concepts.

## üéØ What the Agent Can Learn

### ‚úÖ Learnable Trading Patterns
- **Mean Reversion**: Buy low, sell high when prices deviate from trend
- **Event-Based Trading**: React to market events (crashes, rallies)
- **Risk Management**: Control position sizes and stop losses
- **Market Making**: Provide liquidity and capture spreads
- **Timing**: When to enter/exit positions

### ‚ùå Limitations (Not Learnable)
- **Fundamental Analysis**: No company financials or news
- **Cross-Asset Relationships**: Only single stock trading
- **Market Microstructure**: Simplified order book
- **External Factors**: No economic indicators or sentiment
- **Competition**: No other agents in the market

### üéØ Expected Learning Outcomes
After 100 iterations, you should see the agent developing basic trading strategies and improving its P&L performance.

## üìä Market Simulation Mechanics

### How the Market Moves
- **Mean Reversion**: Prices tend to return to average levels
- **Volatility Clustering**: High volatility periods cluster together
- **Market Events**: Random events cause price spikes/drops
- **Volume Patterns**: Trading volume varies throughout episodes

### What the Agent Observes (11 features)
1. **Current Price**: Latest market price
2. **Price Change**: Recent price movement
3. **Volume**: Current trading volume
4. **Volatility**: Recent price volatility
5. **Position**: Agent's current stock position
6. **Cash**: Available cash balance
7. **Portfolio Value**: Total portfolio worth
8. **Unrealized P&L**: Profit/loss on current position
9. **Time in Position**: How long holding current position
10. **Market Event**: Any active market events
11. **Risk Level**: Current market risk assessment

## üîß Advanced CLI Reference

For advanced users who need full parameter control:

- `--iterations` / `-i`: Number of training iterations
- `--checkpoint-dir` / `-d`: Custom directory to save checkpoints
- `--algorithm` / `-a`: Algorithm choice (ppo/impala/sac/all)

### Evaluation Parameters

**Note**: Dashboard looks for models in `checkpoints/single_agent_demo/`. Use default checkpoint location for dashboard compatibility.

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Customizing Training Parameters
```yaml
# configs/trading_config.yaml
training:
  lr: 0.0001  # Lower learning rate for stability
  train_batch_size: 512  # Larger batches for better gradients
  gamma: 0.95  # Shorter time horizon
  entropy_coeff: 0.05  # More exploration
```

### Custom Market Events
```python
# Add new market events in environments/market_simulator.py
def _generate_market_event(self):
    # Your custom event logic here
    pass
```

### Environment Customization
```python
# Modify environments/trading_environment.py
# - Adjust reward function
# - Change observation space
# - Add new market dynamics
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Low Episode Rewards**: Try increasing learning rate or training iterations
- **High Policy Loss**: Reduce learning rate or increase batch size
- **No Learning**: Check if rewards are properly scaled
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or number of workers
- **Slow Training**: Increase number of workers or use GPU

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Size**: Start with 256, adjust based on memory
- **Workers**: Use 4-8 workers for good performance
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0003 works well for most cases
- **Episode Length**: 128 steps provides good balance
